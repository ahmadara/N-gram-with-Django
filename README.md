# Introduction
One of the significant challenges in artificial intelligence projects is their implementation in real-world scenarios.
In this project, we developed an N-Gram Generator model that is accessible through a Django-based web application. This tool simplifies the generation and exploration of n-grams, making it easier to integrate AI-powered language models into real-world applications.

# Features
Generates n-grams from user-provided text.
User-friendly interface powered by Django.
Easily deployable for production.
Customizable for various NLP tasks.

# Requirements
Install the required dependencies using:

pip install -r requirements.txt
